Minesweeper:
	- Dynamically adjust button sizes if the grid is bigger than 23x40 (that's how many buttons fit on a 1920x1080 screen with the default size).
	- Added animations on mouse hover.
	- Added sound effects for clicking on a mine, opening up a cell, winning, and placing a flag (AudioManager.java).
	- Change cell color when they're open.
	- The window min and pref sizes change automatically based on the grid size.
	- Added an end screen with a timer.
	- Rounded corners on the grid.
